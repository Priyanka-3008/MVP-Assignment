    "Summary": "I used to hate reading books I didn't understand the benefits and nobody could explain them. 
Once I understood I went from zero books per week to sometimes finishing even two.
I've read around 350 books so far in the last 7 years. Reading is like exercise it improves all areas of your life
and all you need is 2 minutes a day. If you want to build a long-term habit you have to start doing it for just 2 minutes
per day. You can't wait for the right time to make a big decision or to complete something so that you can have it in 
its tiniest form. You'll still need to start small and take small actions to build up to the big things you'll do in the
future. If something is important to you right now but you're not sure if you can do it then you might never do it."
